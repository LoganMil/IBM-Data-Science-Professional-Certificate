## Intro to Python

### Identify the Users of Python
- People who already know how to program
- People who want to learn how to program
- Over 80% of DS pros worldwide
- Areas liek DS, AI, ML, Web Dev, IoT devices (Raspberry Pi)
- Large Orgs (IBM, Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, etc)

### Benefits of Python
- General purpose language
- Large standard library
- DS Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- AI Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-Learn
- NLP Library: Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

### Describe the diversity and inclusion efforts of the Python community
>**Our Community**
>
>Members of the Python community are **open**, **considerate**, and **respectful**. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:
>
>- **Being open**. Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise.
>- **Focusing on what is best for the community**. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
>- **Acknowledging time and effort**. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.
>- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences**. We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
>- **Showing empathy towards other community members**. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
>- **Being considerate**. Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users.
>- **Being respectful**. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
>- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
>- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## Intro to Jupyter

>Jupyter is a freely available web application that enables creation and sharing of documents containing **equations**, **live coding**, **visualizations**, and **narrative text**. Jupyter provides an **interactive computing environment** that supports multiple programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and more, but it shines brightest when used with Python.  Jupyter revolves around **notebooks**, documents containing a mix of code, visualizations, narrative text, equations, and multimedia content. These notebooks allow users to create, share, and collaborate on computational projects seamlessly.

### Why Jupyter?
Jupyter's popularity stems from its flexibility and ease of use.

### Key Features of Jupyter

- Interactive Computing
- Support for Multiple Languages
- Rich Output
- Integration with Data Science Libraries
- Collaboration and Sharing

### Jupyter in Data Science

- Jupyter has become an indispensable tool for researchers, analysts, and developers in data science.
- Seamless integration with popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and sci-kit-learn makes it the go-to choice for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning. 
- Jupyter provides a user-friendly interface, interactive capabilities, and robust collaboration features
- Jupyter empowers you to work more efficiently and share your insights with others.
