## 1. Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to? (2 points)

> Credit Cards


## 2. Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer. (3 points)

You are required to:
1. Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected.
2. Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data.

*For example: using the food recipes use case discussed in the labs, the question that we defined was, "Can we automatically determine the cuisine of a given dish based on its ingredients?".*

> 1. Presumably, credit card companies want to offer relevant rewards for current and potential customer to increase usage.
> 2. Can we use various sources of  data regarding customer priorities to provide a reward system that increases the usage of credit cards for current customers and attracts new customers who may not already see enough value in the current credit card product?**


## Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with. (5 points):

1. Analytic Approach

2. Data Requirements

3. Data Collection

4. Data Understanding and Preparation

5. Modeling and Evaluation

*You can always refer to the labs as a reference with describing how you would complete each stage for your problem.*

> **Analytic Approach**\
We would use a descriptive statistics approach to measure the relationships between customer spending habits, customer priorities, and likelihood to start or increase usage of the credit card\
**Data Requirements**\
Customer spending\
customer priorities\
**Data Collection**\
Gathering data from internal information on customer spending (highly sensitive, must be treated appropriately)\
Customer surveys\
Economic market data to see where people's spending habits on trending\
**Data Understandings and Preparation**\
Cleaning data for ease of use and efficient storage\
Pipelines setup for automatic collection of current and relevant data\
Visualization of data for effective communication of customer trends and priorities\
Highlighting missing data to fill in or substitute\
**Modeling and Evaluation**\
The model will be a statistical learning approach because we would be describing customer priorities rather than predicting the effects of our guess on the priorities.\
The model's success will be determined by the changes in usage rates of the card and by customer acquisition rates. Increases in the aforementioned rates are a sign of model success\
